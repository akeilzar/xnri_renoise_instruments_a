rotate 3d shapes on saw and chorus

this shows some nice stuff where u can have 2 waves each filtered by its own chorus independently and the shapes that resemble pieces of pottery blended or sculpted together

the deprtment of the obvious but it helps me when i forget

somehow we are also getting a emergent reverb with this config but i dont know why yet

its just, the reverb, the natural effect of the fadback and not the blending of the two

any benefits of using a chorus over a delay or set of delys/verb???
